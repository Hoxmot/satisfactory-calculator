# Satisfactory calculator

> Work in Progress

I have a specific use-cases in my for the Satisfactory calculator. I'd like it to help me plan my factories,
estimate the output, and calculate overflow. At the same time, I'd like to specifically setup what resources I have
as input.

Unfortunately, none of the existing calculators that I've found are doing what I want them to do.
As a result, I decided to implement one myself.
